  		    <h4 class="text-center">Essential Fortnite Battle Royale tips and tricks</h4>
            <p class="text-center">No matter what Battle Royale game you are playing, there are a number of best practices you should follow to help you survive.</p>
		    <ul>
			  <li>When moving from one location or building to the next, avoid running out in the open if you can help it. Use the cover of trees, buildings or cliffs to help you avoid getting spotted. If you get caught unprepared in someone's cross-hairs, you'll last barely a few seconds.
		      </li>	  
		      <li>Even if you have reached the safe circle, don't assume every other player is also there, as more will be coming from the outside in. Remember this to not only avoid getting shot in the back, but also to your advantage, especially if you can pick advancing players off from the safety of a nearby building.

      <div class="col-lg-9">
        <ul>
          <li>If you do see a player, or hear gunshots nearby, carefully weigh up whether you should approach, as you could easily be outgunned and outnumbered. On the flipside, you could also approach the end of firefight when all other combatants are injured. The reward for taking on other players could be valuable weapons and ammo - but it could also mean the end of your run.</li>
          <li>Headphones are almost essential for playing, allowing you to hear players coming toward you. In Fortnite Battle Royale the sound of movement feels louder louder than most other shooters, giving you ample opportunity to prepare for oncoming adversaries.</li>
          <li>Weapons and resources spawn in buildings and structures, and like PUBG, appears more frequently in populated areas. This doesn't immediately mean you should go there, as they will attract other players doing the same thing. Again, you need to weigh up the risk reward of getting better loot while also coming up against more competition. It's always possible to strike a balance, building up the confidence to explore villages as your arsenal grows, or even ignore most buildings entirely.</li>
